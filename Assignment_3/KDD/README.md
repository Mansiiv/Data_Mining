# Spotify Dataset Analysis - KDD Process

Welcome to the Spotify Dataset Analysis project! This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of the Spotify dataset following the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have executed the KDD process on the Spotify dataset to gain insights into track popularity and related factors. The project is organized into the following components:

1. **CRISP-DM Methodology**: We have followed the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to structure our analysis. This includes phases such as Data Exploration, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment.

2. **IPython Notebook on Google Colab**: The core of our analysis is documented in an IPython Notebook (Jupyter Notebook) hosted on Google Colab. You can access the notebook and explore the code, visualizations, and explanations.

3. **Medium Article**: We have summarized our findings and insights from the analysis in a Medium article. The article provides a high-level overview of the project and its key takeaways. You can read the article [here](link_to_medium_article](https://medium.com/@mansivekaria09/unlocking-the-secrets-of-spotifys-top-tracks-a-data-science-approach-52fc707a0c75).

4. **Research Paper**: For a more detailed and technical understanding of the project, we have authored a research paper. The paper delves into the methodology, results, discussions, and references related to the analysis. 

## How to Use

To explore our analysis and findings, follow these steps:

1. Access the IPython Notebook hosted on Google Colab to review the code and detailed explanations.

2. Read the Medium article for a concise overview of the project's key findings.

3. For a deeper understanding, refer to the research paper, which provides comprehensive details on the methodology and results.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the Spotify dataset, which contains information about music tracks, including various features like danceability, energy, valence, and more.

## Dependencies

To run the IPython Notebook in Google Colab, you won't need to install any dependencies locally. Google Colab provides a ready-to-use environment with all the necessary packages pre-installed.
