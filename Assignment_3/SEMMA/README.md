# Graduation and Employment Prediction: A SEMMA Process

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of a graduation and employment dataset using the SEMMA (Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess) data mining methodology. The project aims to predict student outcomes based on various factors such as age, marital status, GDP, and unemployment rate.

## Project Components

1. **Google Colab Notebook**: An interactive Jupyter notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations.
  
2. **Medium Article**: A detailed article discussing the methodology, findings, and implications of the analysis. You can read it ((https://medium.com/@mansivekaria09/analyzing-student-graduation-rates-using-semma-methodology-2b565dd800a5)
  
3. **Research Paper**: A comprehensive academic paper that includes an in-depth discussion, literature review, and references. The paper follows the SEMMA methodology for data mining.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. You can access it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/).

## Methodology

The project follows the SEMMA methodology which consists of the following steps:

1. **Sample**: A representative sample of the original dataset is selected for analysis.
  
2. **Explore**: Initial data exploration and visualization are performed to understand the dataset's characteristics.
  
3. **Modify**: Data preprocessing steps like handling missing values, outliers, and one-hot encoding are performed.
  
4. **Model**: A Random Forest Classifier model is built and trained on the preprocessed data.
  
5. **Assess**: The model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. A confusion matrix is also presented for a more nuanced understanding.

For more details on each step, please refer to the Google Colab Notebook, Medium article, or the research paper.
