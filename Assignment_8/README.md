# Dimensionality Reduction Techniques in Google Colab

## Overview
This guide outlines creating a Google Colab notebook to demonstrate various dimensionality reduction techniques, including PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE, UMAP, and t-SNE, with different datasets.

## Task 1: Standard Dimensionality Reduction Techniques, Advanced Techniques - UMAP and t-SNE

## Task 2: UMAP with Clustering and Classification

## Task 3: Dimensionality reduction using data bricks

Here I have attached three files where, first one includes -- PCA, SVD, MDS, ISOMap, LLE, UMAP, and t-SNE
second one consists of -- UMAP with Clustering and Classification, third one has-- dimensionality reduction using data bricks

# Dimensionality Reduction Using Databricks

## Overview
This section describes creating a Databricks notebook for dimensionality reduction, integrating with cloud data sources, and visualizing the results.

## Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: Set up Databricks workspace and create a new Python notebook.
2. **Data Loading**: Load data from cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, etc.).
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: Implement techniques like PCA, UMAP using `sklearn` and `umap-learn`.
4. **Visualization**: Visualize the results using Databricks' built-in visualization tools or `matplotlib`.
5. **Analysis**: Examine the effectiveness of each technique on the chosen dataset.
