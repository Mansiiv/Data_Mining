## Machine Learning Project with PyCaret and Google Colab

In this project, we explore and demonstrate the capabilities of PyCaret and Google Colab for these diverse machine learning tasks. PyCaret simplifies the end-to-end machine learning workflow, while Google Colab provides a cloud-based environment for running Python code.
This assignment shows how I have used google colab and pycaret to perfrom a AutoML operations.
Step-by-step guide:

**Setup:**

1.  Refer [Pycaret](https://pycaret.org/), if you haven't already.
2.  Inside the command prompt install PyCaret with Python's pip package manager > `pip install pycaret`
3.  Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)"


## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **`notebooks/`**: This directory contains Google Colab Notebook files, each dedicated to a specific machine learning task.
  - Binary Classification
  -  Multi-Class Classification
  - Clustering
  - Time Series Forecasting (without exogenous values)
  - Time Series Forecasting (with exogenous values)
  - Association Rule Mining
  - Regression
  - Anomaly Detection

- **`README.md`**: This document serves as the main README file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for getting started.
