# Pycaret

This assignment shows how I have used google colab and pycaret to perfrom a AutoML operations.
Step-by-step guide:

**Setup:**

1.  Refer <a href="[https://pycaret.org/](https://pycaret.org/)">Pycaret</a>, if you haven't already.
2.  Inside the command prompt install PyCaret with Python's pip package manager > `pip install pycaret`
3.  Go to <a href="[https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index)">Google Colab</a>

**How to use:**
---

1. Create an empty folder for your project in VScode.
2. Inside that folder, create a file named prompt (with no extension) and write a prompt with instruction/ operation you want to perform.
3. To call that file use cmd ` gpt-engineer <project_dir> `
   For example: gpt-engineer assignment2/data_mining

**Results:**
---

Check the generated files in projects/my-new-project/workspace

**Workflow:**

gpt-engineer --help lets you see all available options.
